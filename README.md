## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge provided good practice creating responsive sites of which I used flexbox to create. I also worked on writing more sematic HTML.

### Continued development

I used flexbox for this solution but I ended up with more wrapper divs than I would have preferred. This solution may have been better implemented using CSS Grid and going forward I plan on looking at the design and better deciding on whether or not Grid would be prefered over Flexbox.
